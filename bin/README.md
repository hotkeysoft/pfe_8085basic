# ASxxxx Cross Assemblers
I'm using unmodified versions of the `as8085.exe` assembler and the `aslink.exe` linker in this project

```
The  ASxxxx  assemblers are a series of microprocessor assem-
blers written in the C programming  language.   This  collection
contains  cross  assemblers  for the 1802, S2650, SC/MP, MPS430,
6100, 61860,  6500,  6800(6802/6808),  6801(6803/HD6303),  6804,
6805,  68HC(S)08,  6809,  68HC11, 68HC(S)12, 68HC16, 740, 78K/0,
78K/0S,  8008,  8008S,  8048(8041/8022/8021)  8051,  8085(8080),
8X300(8X305),   DS8XCXXX,   AVR,   EZ80,   F2MC8L/FX,   F8/3870,
GameBoy(Z80), H8/3xx, Cypress PSoC(M8C), PIC, Rabbit  2000/3000,
ST6,  ST7,  ST8,  Z8, Z80(HD64180), and Z280 series microproces-
sors.  Each  assembler  has  a  device  specific  section  which
includes:   (1)  device description, byte order, and file exten-
sion information, (2) a table of assembler  general  directives,
special directives, assembler mnemonics and associated operation
codes, (3) machine  specific  code  for  processing  the  device
mnemonics, addressing modes, and special directives.
